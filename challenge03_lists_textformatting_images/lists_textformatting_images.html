        <h2><strong><em>Directions</em></strong></h2>

            <p>
                Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place a large pot of water on to boil for spaghetti. 
                When it boils, add salt and pasta and cook to al dente. Mix beef and Worcestershire, 
                egg, bread crumbs, cheese, garlic, salt and pepper. Roll meat into 1 1/2 inch medium-sized 
                meatballs and place on nonstick cookie sheet or a cookie sheet greased with extra-virgin 
                olive oil. Bake balls 10 to 12 minutes, until no longer pink. Heat a deep skillet or 
                medium pot over moderate heat. Add oil, crushed pepper, garlic and finely chopped onion. 
                Saute 5 to 7 minutes, until onion bits are soft. Add beef stock, crushed tomatoes, and herbs. 
                Bring to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes. Toss hot, drained pasta with a few ladles 
                of the sauce and grated cheese. Turn meatballs in remaining sauce. Place pasta on dinner 
                plates and top with meatballs and sauce and extra grated cheese. Serve with bread or garlic 
                bread (and some good chianti!)

                <strong>End Result</strong>
            </h2>

                <p>
                        The final big question is whether to toss the spaghetti straight into the meatballs and sauce or not. The classic presentation 
                        is to put the spaghetti down first and then layer on the meatballs and sauce. Personally, I like to mix the spaghetti straight 
                        into the sauce. For one thing, this helps prevent the spaghetti from sticking together. It also makes the dish easier to eat as 
                        you donâ€™t need to mix the components together on your plate. But perhaps the most compelling reason to mix everything in the pan 
                        is that it gives the spaghetti, meatballs, and sauce a chance to get friendly, marrying the textures, tastes, and flavors in a 
                        way that can only happen over heat. Still, layering the components does look very pretty...
