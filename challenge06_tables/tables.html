                <li>Cross-reference (Table Of Contents)</li>

                    <p>
                        A table of contents usually includes the titles or descriptions of first-level headings 
                        (chapters in longer works), and often includes second-level headings (sections or A-heads) 
                        within the chapters as well, and occasionally even includes third-level headings 
                        (subsections or B-heads) within the sections as well. The depth of detail in tables of contents 
                        depends on the length of the work, with longer works having less. Formal reports 
                        (ten or more pages and being too long to put into a memo or letter) also have a table of contents. 
                        Within an English-language book, the table of contents usually appears after the title page, 
                        copyright notices, and, in technical journals, the abstract; and before any lists of tables or 
                        figures, the foreword, and the preface.

                    <li>Arithmetic (Multiplication table)</li>

                    <p>
                        A multiplication table (sometimes, less formally, a times table) is a mathematical table used to define a multiplication operation for an algebraic system.
                        The decimal multiplication table was traditionally taught as an essential part of elementary arithmetic around the world, as it lays the foundation for 
                        arithmetic operations with base-ten numbers. Many educators believe it is necessary to memorize the table up to 9 × 9.

                    <li>Logic (Truth table)</li>

                    <p>
                            A truth table is a mathematical table used in logic—specifically in connection with Boolean algebra, boolean functions, and propositional calculus—which 
                            sets out the functional values of logical expressions on each of their functional arguments, that is, for each combination of values taken by their logical 
                            variables (Enderton, 2001). In particular, truth tables can be used to show whether a propositional expression is true for all legitimate input values, 
                            that is, logically valid.

                    <p>
                        The periodic table, or periodic table of elements, is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, ordered by their atomic number, electron configuration, 
                        and recurring chemical properties, whose structure shows periodic trends. Generally, within one row (period) the elements are metals to the left, and non-metals 
                        to the right, with the elements having similar chemical behaviours placed in the same column. Table rows are commonly called periods and columns are called groups. 
                        Six groups have accepted names as well as assigned numbers: for example, group 17 elements are the halogens; and group 18 are the noble gases. Also displayed are 
                        four simple rectangular areas or blocks associated with the filling of different atomic orbitals.

                    <p>
                        Tide tables, sometimes called tide charts, are used for tidal prediction and show the daily times and levels of high and low tides, usually for a particular location.

                                A spreadsheet is an interactive computer application for organization, analysis and storage of data in tabular form.[1][2][3] Spreadsheets are developed as 
                                computerized simulations of paper accounting worksheets.[4] The program operates on data entered in cells of a table. Each cell may contain either numeric 
                                or text data, or the results of formulas that automatically calculate and display a value based on the contents of other cells. A spreadsheet may also refer 
                                to one such electronic document.

                                A presentation program is a software package used to display information in the form of a slide show. It has three major functions: an editor that allows 
                                text to be inserted and formatted, a method for inserting and manipulating graphic images, and a slide-show system to display the content.

                    <p>
                        Tables have uses in software development for both high-level specification and low-level implementation. Usage in software specification can encompass ad hoc 
                        inclusion of simple decision tables in textual documents through to the use of tabular specification methodologies, examples of which include SCR and Statestep. 
                        Proponents of tabular techniques, among whom David Parnas is prominent, emphasize their understandability, as well as the quality and cost advantages of a format 
                        allowing systematic inspection, while corresponding shortcomings experienced with a graphical notation were cited in motivating the development of at least 
                        two tabular approaches. At a programming level, software may be implemented using constructs generally represented or understood as tabular, whether to store data 
                        (perhaps to memoize earlier results), for example, in arrays or hash tables, or control tables determining the flow of program execution in response to various 
                        events or inputs.

                        Database systems often store data in structures called tables; in which columns are data fields and rows represent data records.
